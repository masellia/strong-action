### About STRONG

The scientific programme of **STRONG** is organised into four tightly connected work packages (WPs), 
each addressing a key aspect of strong-field gravity and gravitational-wave physics. Together, they 
cover theoretical foundations, waveform modelling, numerical simulations, and the interpretation of
 observations in current and future detectors.

Click on each work package below to explore its scientific scope and objectives.

        WP1 focuses on the fundamental properties of compact objects in strong gravitational fields.
        It addresses the modelling of black holes, neutron stars, and exotic compact objects, with particular attention to deviations from standard assumptions such as vacuum spacetimes and point-particle descriptions.

        The work package explores analytical and perturbative approaches to strong-field gravity, including the role of additional fields and modified dynamics, providing theoretical benchmarks for waveform modelling and numerical simulations developed in other WPs.

      <div class="card-body">
        WP2 is dedicated to the construction of accurate and flexible gravitational-wave models.
        It develops waveform frameworks that go beyond standard vacuum and quasi-circular assumptions, incorporating strong-field effects, environmental influences, and possible signatures of new physics.

        These models are designed to bridge analytical results, numerical simulations, and data-analysis requirements, enabling precision tests of gravity with current and next-generation detectors.

    <div id="wp3" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="wp3-heading" data-parent="#wpAccordion">
      <div class="card-body">
        WP3 focuses on numerical-relativity simulations of compact-object systems in regimes where analytical methods are insufficient.
        This includes binary mergers, highly dynamical strong-field processes, and scenarios involving non-standard compact objects or matter environments.

        The simulations developed in WP3 provide essential input for waveform validation, calibration, and interpretation, and serve as a testing ground for theoretical predictions explored in WP1 and WP2.

      <div class="card-body">
        WP4 addresses the extraction of physical information from gravitational-wave data.
        It focuses on data-analysis strategies for current and future detectors, including parameter estimation, model selection, and consistency tests of gravity.

        By combining advanced waveform models with robust statistical techniques, WP4 enables the translation of observational data into constraints on compact-object properties, astrophysical environments, and fundamental physics.
