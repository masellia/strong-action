### About STRONG

The scientific programme of **STRONG** is structured into four tightly connected work packages (WPs), 
each addressing a key challenge in strong-field gravity and gravitational-wave physics. Together, 
they span environmental effects, extensions of General Relativity, exotic compact objects, and 
data-analysis strategies for current and future detectors.

        WP1 investigates how matter fields interact with and influence black holes in strong-gravity regimes.
        The focus is on developing a comprehensive relativistic framework for black-hole solutions embedded in realistic astrophysical environments and on characterising their physical properties.

        A central goal of this work package is to understand how environmental effects modify gravitational-wave emission.
        To this end, WP1 studies the associated signals and develops waveform models for both asymmetric systems and comparable-mass binaries, providing key inputs for precision tests of gravity and astrophysical inference.

        WP2 addresses gravitational-wave signatures of theories beyond General Relativity, with particular emphasis on the role of additional fundamental fields.
        The objective is to develop accurate waveform models that describe the full coalescence of binary black holes in selected beyond-GR scenarios.

        This work package combines numerical relativity and perturbative techniques to cover the mass range relevant for future gravitational-wave detectors.
        In parallel, WP2 develops novel effective-field-theory approaches specifically tailored to asymmetric binaries, which are prime targets for space-based observatories.

          WP3 — Coherent models of Exotic Compact Objects

      </h5>

        WP3 is dedicated to the modelling of Exotic Compact Objects (ECOs) and to the construction of the first full-coalescence gravitational-wave signals for these systems.
        The aim is to capture deviations from the Kerr black-hole paradigm across all phases of the coalescence process.

        The work focuses on concrete and well-motivated models—such as scalar and vector boson stars and topological stars—for which members of the STRONG consortium have already produced seminal results.
        By exploring the parameter space of these models, WP3 seeks to span a broad and representative family of black-hole mimickers and to identify robust observational signatures of their exotic nature.

        WP4 integrates the waveform models developed in WPs 1–3 into advanced data-analysis pipelines for gravitational-wave observations.
        The work package extends existing inference frameworks with new algorithms for parameter estimation and model selection, tailored to both comparable-mass and asymmetric systems.

        For comparable-mass binaries, WP4 builds on the Bilby framework, while dedicated inference tools based on FEW are developed for asymmetric binaries.
        Analyses are performed using simulated data from next-generation space- and ground-based detectors, supported by astrophysically motivated source catalogues.
        All tools are released to the community to maximise scientific impact and enable direct application to LVK data.
