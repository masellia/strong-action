The **STRONG** project is motivated by the rapid progress of gravitational-wave astronomy and by the need for accurate theoretical frameworks to interpret observations in the strong-field regime of gravity.

The scientific programme focuses on compact objects—such as black holes, neutron stars, and exotic compact objects—and on the gravitational waves emitted during their dynamical evolution and mergers. These systems provide unique laboratories to test General Relativity under extreme conditions, to assess the impact of realistic astrophysical environments, and to search for possible imprints of new fundamental fields or deviations from standard gravity.

STRONG addresses these challenges through a coordinated research effort that integrates:
- analytical and perturbative methods for strong-field gravity,
- numerical relativity simulations of compact-object binaries,
- waveform modelling beyond standard vacuum and point-particle assumptions,
- and data-analysis strategies tailored to current and future gravitational-wave detectors.

By combining these approaches within a coherent scientific framework, STRONG aims to deliver validated modelling tools, improved theoretical understanding, and a solid foundation for the scientific exploitation of next-generation gravitational-wave observations.
