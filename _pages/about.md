STRONG (Strong Gravity Crossroads: fundamental fields in the High-Energy Universe) is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action funded under the Staff Exchanges scheme. The project is motivated by the rapid progress of gravitational-wave astronomy and by the need for robust theoretical frameworks capable of interpreting future observations in the strong-field regime of gravity.

The scientific programme of STRONG focuses on compact objects—such as black holes and exotic compact objects—and on the gravitational waves they emit during dynamical processes and mergers. These systems provide unique opportunities to test General Relativity, to investigate the influence of astrophysical environments, and to search for signatures of new fundamental fields or deviations from standard gravity.

To address these goals, STRONG develops and connects a range of complementary approaches, including:
- analytical and perturbative methods for strong-field gravity,
- numerical relativity simulations of compact-object binaries,
- waveform modelling beyond standard assumptions,
- and data-analysis strategies for current and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

Through this integrated scientific effort, STRONG aims to deliver new theoretical insights, validated modelling tools, and a coherent research framework that will support the long-term scientific exploitation of gravitational-wave observations.
