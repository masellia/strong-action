### Strong Gravity at the Frontiers of Fundamental Physics
<br>
**STRONG** is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Staff Exchange Action dedicated to investigating 
gravity in its most extreme regimes, where compact objects, high-energy phenomena, and 
fundamental fields interact.

The direct detection of gravitational waves has transformed our ability to observe the 
Universe, turning black holes and neutron stars into precision laboratories for testing 
gravity under conditions that cannot be reproduced on Earth. As future ground- and space-based 
detectors come online, the scientific challenge is no longer detection alone, but the 
accurate interpretation of increasingly complex signals.

STRONG addresses this challenge by advancing theoretical and computational tools for modelling 
compact objects and their gravitational-wave emission, with the aim of probing strong-field 
gravity, characterising astrophysical environments, and exploring possible extensions of 
General Relativity and of the Standard Model of particle physics and Comsology.

By bringing together expertise across gravitational physics, astrophysics, and 
high-energy theory, STRONG contributes to the scientific foundations required 
for the next generation of gravitational-wave observations and to the 
training of researchers working at the interface of these disciplines.

### Objectives
<br>
STRONG pursues the following overarching objectives:

- **Advance theoretical modelling of compact objects and gravitational waves** in regimes where strong-field gravity, astrophysical environments, and fundamental fields play a central role.
- **Explore signatures of new physics**, that can manifest as new fundamental fields coupled to gravity, or exotic forms of matter.
- **Develop robust and flexible waveform frameworks** suitable for the analysis of data from current and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.
- **Strengthen interdisciplinary training and expertise** at the interface of gravitational physics, astrophysics, and high-energy theory.
